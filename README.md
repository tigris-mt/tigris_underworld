# Lightwood
Lightwood trees grow on stone with coal or coal blocks. They will spawn naturally anywhere stone with coal is found. Their wood glows.

# Mushrooms
The various glowing mushrooms spawn on stone with iron. They will spread to nearby stone, soil, and tree trunks if the area doesn't already have several glowing mushrooms. All glowing mushrooms are edible.

# Insect Traps
Place the empty trap near glowing mushrooms to attract insects. They will stick to it and eventually form a conglomerate on the trap, which you can then cook into an edible food.
